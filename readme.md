This was made with 1920 x 1080 display resolution, but as of 2022-08-27, this display was rewrittin and improved to support your needs,
yesterday, I realized how terrible this looks and should rewrite it, which is what I did. I changed everything about it and it is now mobile responsive and should work with most other resolutions for desktops and mobiles!


If you have any ideas on how to improve this, make a PR (Pull Request), I'm sure I'll take a look at it as soon as I am not busy. Make any joke PRs (PUll Requests) and I will block you from viewing this repository and my profiles if it continues. 


Documentation is pretty straight forward, doc your code so I can actually read it, make sure it's clean and not bloat code, and make sure it's readable.
