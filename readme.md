This was made with 1920 x 1080 resolution, meaning that anything below or above will not be supported. This is because I made the login template just for my resolution. No, I did not do that on purpose. 


If you end up wanting to use this template for your client / Website, please make it display friendly and mobile friendly for your users. If you do plan on doing that then I suggest you please make a pull request about it, I've yet to learn how to make it Mobile friendly and Display friendly and wish to know for future projects.


If there is any suggestions you want added please make sure to make an issue or if you know how to implement the feature make a pull request. If you choose to make an issue / feature request please format it correctly. Providing probable solutions to your issue / feature request will help me to understand your issue / feature request and help me to implement it. On the other hand if you choose to make a PR (Pull Request) then please provide documentation, proper formatting in the code as well as documentation explaining what it is, how it works and why it is needed for this project.

Making issues to make fun of me will be automatically closed, making more of these issues will result in you being blacklisted from viewing this repository(s), and of course the amount of spam issues you make will reuslt in your blacklist of the repository, if you try to make more of these issues then you will be blacklisted from viewing my profile.
